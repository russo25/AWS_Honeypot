# AWS 2013 Honeypot Project

This project explores the use of R and the ggplot module for visualization. It considers such questions as:

1. Is there a relationship between source and attack port by a would-be cyber-attacker (in 2013)?
2. Where is thye "center of gravity" of all worldwide cyber-attacks?
3. What are the most common ports and protocols used in an attack?

These work in R offers some coding suggestions and some key features of ggplot to improve data visualization. The Powerpoint slides conclude with "Lessons Learned" for the newbie R programmer.  Enjoy!
