# AWS 2013 Honeypot Project

This project explores the use of R and the ggplot module for visualization. It considers such questions as:

1. Is there a relationship between source and attack port by a would-be cyber-attacker (in 2013)?
2. Where is the "center of gravity" of all worldwide cyber-attacks?
3. What are the most common ports and protocols used in an attack?
4. Who are the major threats in cyberspace?

This work in R offers some coding suggestions and some key features of ggplot to improve data visualization. Also, included are data wrangling efforts to include 'mutate' and 'melt' features of the available data.  The Powerpoint slides conclude with "Lessons Learned" for the newbie R programmer.  Enjoy!
